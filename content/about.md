I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area, city of Berkeley (U.S.), where I go to college. I've also lived in Shanghai (China) and São Paulo (Brazil) at different moments of my life. In addition to English, I speak Portuguese, Mandarin, and some intermediate Spanish.

<!-- I like Linux and Computer Systems. I've built data pipelines at [Stone](https://investors.stone.co/) and cloud infrastructure at [Sigma](https://www.sigmacomputing.com/). I've also been facilitating some systems classes at Berkeley, like EE122 and the Linux Decal. Finally, I'm a manager at the [Open Computing Facility](https://ocf.io), where I work on various campus [IT and compute services](https://github.com/ocf). -->

In my spare time, I really enjoy cooking, and am considering starting a food blog (coming soon?). I'm fond of all type of racket sports, like tennis, badminton, and ping pong. I also play videos games, like [Stellaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game)) and [StarCraft II](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/).
