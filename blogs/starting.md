I started writing for fun in fifth grade, when I got my first diary. It was a light-green, small notebook with hard cover. I wrote things in Mandarin, mostly documenting littles things on a whim. My second diary was a white-and-blue fabric covered notebook. I started writing in Portuguese. I wrote about all my troubles and reflections in secondary school. As I loved to the US for college, I moved digital. I started writing in English, and used my essays to reflect about deeper thoughts. Their lengths vary a lot, anything from 20 to 1000 words.

I hate writing for class. Essays were not my strong suit, partially because I had to juggle a few languages. However, I’ve always enjoyed writing for myself: I don’t have to worry about following a structure, using precise grammar, or making things clear for other readers. Writing for myself is like dumping everything in my head onto a paper, effortless. 

About a year ago, I met a few friends who had their own internet blog. It was the first time I ever considered showing my writings to others in a systematic way. Last week I was wandering around in a book store and I picked up a book called “Like Streams to the Ocean” by Jedidiah Jenkins. I rarily read, but I decided to give it a chance. It was interesting, and I resonated with the way the author wrote about his life. It felt like one of those 3am talks with a friend, and it was exactly what I want to write about. Spring break was next week, so I finally decided to start my blog.

I once asked a close friend why wouldn’t she become a writer if she loved writting and reading so much. She said that writing is scary, it shows too much of oneself to the world. As I planned my blog, her point started to feel more real. In other social media, we post snippets about ourselves, and others try to piece them together to get a sense of who we are. But writing a blog is different; it is distilled information, stark and direct. It shows the way we think, and the way we see the world. It is like a panopticon into ourselves. We can never be sure what it can lead to.

However, there is also excitement around letting the world know what you think. I think many of us are too occupied with our own thoughts, and we often reduce others to caricatures with superficial ideas. For most people in our lives, we are just caricatures within their own complex life. This makes writing blogs exciting for me. I get to show the world how I think, who I am. I hope I am not just an oversimplied version of myself to others.

So, here is my first blog. I hope you are interested.
